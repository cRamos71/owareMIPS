MIPS Assembly OWARE Game

This repository contains the source code for a MIPS assembly implementation of the OWARE game. This project serves as an educational tool for students to reinforce their understanding of MIPS assembly programming concepts learned in the classroom. 

Project Overview: 

The OWARE game is implemented to run in a console environment, allowing users to interact with the game through input from the console. After each move, the current state of the game board is displayed.  

Getting Started: 

To run the OWARE game: Ensure you have the MARS simulator installed on your system. Load the MIPS assembly code for the OWARE game into the MARS simulator. Run the simulation. 

Gameplay: 


Follow the prompts in the console to make moves and interact with the game. After each move, the current state of the game board will be displayed in the console.
